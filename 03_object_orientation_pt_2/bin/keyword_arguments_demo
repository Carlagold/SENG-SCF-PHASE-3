puts <<-CODE
Try the following: 
```rb
@lennon = Dog.new(
  name: "Lennon Snow",
  age: "2 years",
  breed: "Pomeranian",
  image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/dnocv6uwb/image/upload/v1609370267/dakota-and-lennon-square-compressed_hoenfo.jpg"
)
```

Then leave off a keyword:

```rb
@lennon = Dog.new(
  name: "Lennon Snow",
  age: "2 years",
  breed: "Pomeranian"
)
```

Then let's say we wanted to add favorite_treats as an option upon initialization
```rb
@lennon = Dog.new(
  name: "Lennon Snow",
  age: "2 years",
  breed: "Pomeranian",
  image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/dnocv6uwb/image/upload/v1609370267/dakota-and-lennon-square-compressed_hoenfo.jpg",
  favorite_treats: "Apples, Carrots, and Cheese!"
)
```
